## Purpose

Independent artisans struggle to find accessible platforms to showcase their handmade goods, while consumers seeking unique items lack a dedicated space to discover authentic handcrafted products. Handcrafted Haven solves this problem by creating an online marketplace where artisans can establish virtual storefronts and connect directly with customers who value handmade craftsmanship.

* Filter all products by category and price (low to high or high to low)
* View stores by other users and their own store where they can edit or delete their products
* Profile view where a user can see their favorites, their cart, their order history, their saved payment methods, and create or view their store
* Users can complete an order in their cart view
